# Interactive Color Changing Elements

This web project showcases the dynamic color changing of text and an icon using JavaScript. It includes two functions, `textDiv` and `tempLoad`, that manipulate the styles of HTML elements to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Observe the main heading's color changing dynamically every 5 seconds.
3. The icon in the span with id `temp` also changes its color in sync with the main heading.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The HTML file containing the main structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for dynamic color changes.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the interactive color-changing elements.
